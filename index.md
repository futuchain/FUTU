## Futuchain whitepaper & roadmap (work in progress - contracts not out yet, don't fall for scams please)

Establishing a new level of web governance by entering into international agreements with projects of high value for the rebirth of an IOT 3.0 

## The DAO

FUTUCHAIN Decentralize collaborations between individuals and companies, simplifying their connection through partnership services and facilitations for token governance holders (FUTU)

## Problem

Solve the lack of decentralized connections between individuals and companies, give greater possibility to connect freely and anonymously in any place and time to companies and individuals open to collaborations and partnerships. 


## Solution

Create a network of contacts between different sectors able to interact autonomously in the community and raise funds in a decentralized way thanks to the technology of the ERC-20 futuchain contract $FUTU. Equity token holders will be able to actively participate in the dao benefiting from all the facilities and partnerships, choosing whether to remain anonymous thanks to the security of the DeFi. Creators will be able to get in direct contact with investors by taking advantage of the IC internet conjoiner protocol, a platform that will list several projects that can be published through the purchase of FUTU tokens, thus becoming a token governance holder having the opportunity to take advantage of partnership and funding services.

## Eco

Futuchain: $FUTU=DeFi (erc 20)

$RIST: semi decentralized(bsc)

Futuchan: online community

Internet conjoiner: collect liquidity projects

## Tokens

### $FUTU

Tokenomics $FUTU 

Liquidity growth 
3% of each transfer or sale is permanently added to the liquidity - then 2% - then 1% - then 0.5% forever after the contract has been renounced 

Development fund portfolio 
1% of each transfer or exchange is added to futuristic engine's development portfolio 

Waigoing capital duty By selling $FUTU, you also pay an exit fee of 3% of your sale, this percentage goes into a pool of liquidity dedicated to future airdrops. Giving up your governance token before the airdrop has been made will result in a loss of capital, only FUTU holders will receive the monthly airdrops.

### $RIST

Tokenomics $RIST

Liquidity growth 2% of each transfer or transaction is permanently added to liquidity 

Development fund portfolio 1% of each transfer or exchange is added to futuristic engine's development portfolio
